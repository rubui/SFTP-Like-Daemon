This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Melanie Lum (mhlum@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Rebecca Bui (rubui@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair is
responsible for the work performed by the other partner,
and has been reviewed by both partners working together.

We edited our code to print out some error messages and
statements about what kind of messages were received. We
also left most of the professor's code. 

When we looked at the SCORE file, it said a "get" should
send back a CIX_FILE packet, according to the assignment
doc,  we interpreted this as CIX_FILEOUT instead.
